					       		<p>You must believe in yourself and your abilities at all times. You will never be perfect, because if you were then there would be nothing to improve upon, and no growth to gain. Never doubt yourself in any capacity for even an instant.</p>
					       		<h5>Model Great Players</h5>
					       		<p>Great players have learned hard lessons that have brought them to the pinnacles of their careers as professional basketball athletes. Learn from their mistakes, learn from their movements, copy their fundamental skills, and most importantly model their mindset. It is after all their mindset that has kept them at such a high level of achievement over an extended period of time. Without it they would be nothing. Yet with it, the World is their Oyster.</p>

					       		<h5>Believe in Your Coach and Teammates</h5>
					       		<p>When we are “believed in” by others, an incredible force begins to move us to even higher levels of success. This is why it is absolutely critical that you openly support your Teammates and Coach at all times. A little belief in another person can go a very long way. And the funny thing is, that this “Belief” you project to others will usually boomerang back in your direction. And that can only be great for your team spirit and moral.</p>
					       		<h5>Cultivate Friendship</h5>
					       		<p>We enjoy playing most with close friends and people we know well and respect from the bottom of our hearts. If you are not friends with everyone on your team, then take the time this week to get to know them a little more. Ask them questions about their life, about their family, about their interests and hobbies. The more you get to know a person, the more things in common you will find, and this can only help to bring the both of you closer together.</p>

					       	<h5>Beware of Making Excuses</h5>
					       	<p>Excuses only breed more excuses, that breed even more excuses in an unending cycle that never seems to subside. When you step out onto the basketball court, throw your excuses out the door. No one cares that you are not shooting well today, that the Umpires are not giving you a break, or a myriad of other possible excuses you could make. Excuses are for losers. No one likes to hear them, except for the person making them. Breed this self-sabotaging habit out of your game immediately. If you don’t, then it will eat you alive and sabotage your growth as a basketball player.</p>	
					       	<h5>Beware of Reacting Emotionally</h5>
					       	<p>Always stay in control of your emotions no matter what happens on or off the basketball court. When you react emotionally you effectively lose your intellect. And when your intellect gets kicked out the door, then your decision making begins to fail, and you begin to fall down a spiral that spins your head and emotions in an uncontrollable manner right down to the bottom of the pit.</p>
					       	<h5>Beware of Fearing to Make Mistakes</h5>  
					       	<p>Basketball is a game of mistakes. As a matter a fact, life is all about making mistakes. When we make mistakes we learn, we grow, and we improve our efforts the next time around. You must take this frame of mind into every basketball game, and as a consequence grow yourself physically, emotionally and mentally as a solid and intelligent basketball player.</p>
